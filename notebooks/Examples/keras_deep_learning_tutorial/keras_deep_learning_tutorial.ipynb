    "\n",
    "Models in Keras are defined as a sequence of layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a [Sequential model](https://keras.io/models/sequential/) and add layers one at a time until we are happy with our network architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to get right is to ensure the input layer has the right number of input features. This can be specified when creating the first layer with the input_dim argument and setting it to 8 for the 8 input variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know the number of layers and their types?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very hard question. There are heuristics that we can use and often the best network structure is found through a process of trial and error experimentation ([see this explination](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-configure-the-number-of-layers-and-nodes-in-a-neural-network/)). Generally, you need a network large enough to capture the structure of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will use a fully-connected network structure with three layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully connected layers are defined using the [Dense class](https://keras.io/layers/core/). We can specify the number of neurons or nodes in the layer as the first argument, and specify the activation function using the activation argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [rectified linear unit activation function](https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks/) referred to as ReLU on the first two layers and the Sigmoid function in the output layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "It used to be the case that Sigmoid and Tanh activation functions were preferred for all layers. These days, better performance is achieved using the ReLU activation function. We use a sigmoid on the output layer to ensure our network output is between 0 and 1 and easy to map to either a probability of class 1 or snap to a hard classification of either class with a default threshold of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can piece it all together by adding each layer:\n",
    "- The model expects rows of data with 8 variables (the input_dim=8 argument)\n",
    "- The first hidden layer has 12 nodes and uses the relu activation function.\n",
    "- The second hidden layer has 8 nodes and uses the relu activation function.\n",
    "- The output layer has one node and uses the sigmoid activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**, the most confusing thing here is that the shape of the input to the model lis defined as an argument on the first hidden layer. This means that the line of code that adds the first Dense layer is doing 2 things, defining the input or visible layer and the first hidden layer."

    "I generally recommend to always create a summary and a plot of your neural network model in Keras.\n",

    "I recommend this for a few reasons:\n",
    "- Confirm layer order. It is easy to add layers in the wrong order with the sequential API or to connect them together incorrectly with the functional API. The graph plot can help you confirm that the model is connected the way you intended.\n",
    "- Confirm the output shape of each layer. It is common to have problems when defining the shape of input data for complex networks like convolutional and recurrent neural networks. The summary and plot can help you confirm the input shape to the network is as you intended.\n",
