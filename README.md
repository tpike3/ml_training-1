A carefully-curated repository of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS) literature with practical implementations using Jupyter Notebook "skill-builders".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview
The Data Science Boot Camp (DSBC) team has spent years developing tools and training materials for Applied Math and Data Science. In this project you will find the following tools.
* ["5 Questions a Data Scientist Should Ask Their Customer"](https://github.com/pfroysdon/books/blob/master/math_notes/DS_Questions.pdf) is a one-page list of questions any data scientist should have with them to define the problem they are trying to solve and set expectations with their customer.
* ["Notes on ..."](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/math_notes) these are cheat sheets on various topics of math for Machine Learning, e.g. algebra, probability theory, etc., as well as Machine Learning topics, e.g. linear regression, hypothesis testing, etc.
* ["Machine Learning flow-charts"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/flow-chart) will help you navigate the enormous number of algorithms.  These will help you select what algorithm or plot you need to complete your task, based on the data that you have and the desired outcome or story you are trying to tell.
* ["Cheat-Sheets"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/cheat_sheets) are for various Python toolboxes, e.g. [Numpy](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/Numpy_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [MatPlotLib](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/MatPlotLib_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [SciKitLearn](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/SciKitLearn_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [Keras](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/Keras_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), etc.
* ["10 steps to Data Science"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/10-steps-to-DS) is a series of notebooks to teach you the most common tools used in Data Science.
* ["10 steps to Machine Learning"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/10-steps-to-ML) is a series of notebooks to teach you some advanced tools used in Machine Learning. 
* ["Python in 2 days"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Python-in-2-days) is a series of notebooks to get you started in Juypter notebooks and Python.
* ["Machine Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Machine-Learning-in-1-day) is a series of notebooks focused on a basic toolbox for Machine Learning.
* ["Deep Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Deep-Learning-in-1-day)  is a series of notebooks focused on advanced CNNs, RNNs, GANs and Transformers.
* ["Examples"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Examples)  is a series of notebooks that most folks will find useful for a variety of real-life applications of Data Science.


## The DSBC Approach

</p>
The DSBC team teaches AI/ML, and more broadly Data Science, with two approaches:

### "Top-Down" Approach
In the Top-Down approach, you don't need to know the math, or be a deep expert in Python.
We will teach you the tools, using industry best practices and rules-of-thumb, so that you will be a solid contributing member of a Data Science team. 

To get started, we recommend the following self-paced tutorials performed in order:
1. ["Python in 2 days"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Python-in-2-days).
2. ["Machine Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Machine-Learning-in-1-day).
3. ["Deep Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Deep-Learning-in-1-day).

### "Bottom-Up" Approach
In the Bottom-Up approach, we assume that you already have a solid foundation in math and/or computer science.
We will teach you the algorithms, both how to manipulate and optimize them for your application.
With these powerful skills, you will be a technical leader enabling the full potential of a Data Science team.

To get started, we recommend that you review the following:
1. [ML technical notes](https://github.com/pfroysdon/books/blob/master/math_notes).
2. ["Math Refresher for Machine Learning"](https://github.com/pfroysdon/books/tree/master/Math_Refresher_for_Machine_Learning).
3. ["Machine Learning: A Conceptual Approach"](https://github.com/pfroysdon/books/tree/master/Machine_Learning_a_Conceptual_Approach).
